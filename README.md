##Eloquent JavaScript Ch 7 Project

Project excersise from Eloquent Javascript Chapter 7: Our project in this chapter is to build a virtual ecosystem, a little world populated with critters that move around and struggle for survival.
See http://eloquentjavascript.net/07_elife.html

Note: most of this is copied - only a few critter types are mine:
(none of these are currently implemented)
SmartPlantEater
Tiger
